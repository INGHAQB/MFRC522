Arduino RFID Library for MF522-AN (13.56 Mhz)
=================================
> Name: MF522-AN
> Design: C_CL
> Date: 10-06-10

Pin order, starting from the bottom left hand pin
(in case your MF522-AN doesn't have pin markings like the B2CQSHOP one):

| Pins | SPI      | UNO  | Mega2560    |
| ---- |:--------:| ----:| --------:   |
| 1    | SS       |  10  |  53         |
| 2    | SCK      |  13  |  52         |
| 3    | MOSI     |  11  |  51         |
| 4    | MISO     |  12  |  50         |
| 5    |          | None               |
| 6    |          | GND                |
| 7    |          | RST (Digital Pin 5)|
| 8    |          | +3.3V              |

Using MF522-AN with other SPI components
========================================
If you are planning to use other SPI components you just have to make sure each have an exclusive SS (Slave Select) line.
MISO, MOSI and SCK lines may be shared. More reference regarding SPI may be found [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI).
